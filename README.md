# Styx3D

Tryna rework Jet3D to work on modern systems, port it to some homebrew consoles, like DreamCast and PSP, and maybe add some features that will improve QOL, like perhaps scripting.

## Rationale

There aren't really any other engines out there that are of this vintage under permissive licenses with the following feature set:

- Skeletal models/animations
- BSP 3D level format which can be modeled in a brush-based editor
- Networked multiplayer
- Fixed function pipeline 
- Tools

## Plans

- [x] Get it compiling on Linux & other modern systems (in progress)
  
  - [ ] Get a window to launch
  
  - [ ] Get something drawn to the screen

- [x] Port to SDL3 where possible
  
  - [ ] Still gotta port software video driver to SDL

- [x] Modernize for Windows 11
  
  - [x] Update to Visual Studio 2022 (v143 toolset)
  
  - [x] Add x64 platform configurations
  
  - [x] Update Windows SDK to 10.0 (latest)

- [x] Add DirectX 12 rendering backend
  
  - [x] Implement Direct3D12Driver with full DRV_Driver interface
  
  - [x] Support for texture management, polygon caching, and scene rendering
  
  - [x] Modern shader-based rendering pipeline

- [ ] Clean up directory structure

- [ ] Implement an OpenGL 1.1 rendering backend

- [ ] Add support for game data being stored in a compressed format, like PK3 or WAD

- [ ] Get it ported to DreamCast, GameCube, PS2, and PSP

- [ ] Create command-line versions of the tools

- [ ] Port the tools to Linux as well, making use of the libAgar toolkit

- [ ] Maybe add scripting support (Lua or [Umka](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang))

## Contributing:

If you'd like to contribute, take note that this code is to be released under the 0BSD license, which is public domain-equivalent. This is not much different from most permissive licenses like MIT or 2-clause BSD, but it does not require attribution or the inclusion of the license in any derivative work, so keep that in mind if you wish to contribute.

Contributions should follow the [Suckless coding style](https://suckless.org/coding_style/).

- Currently, there is no consistent style in this code, so contributions of just styling the code would be very welcome.

## License

Genesis3D was originally distributed under the Genesis3D public license, however, according to the [Jet3D website](https://www.jet3d.com/licensing.html), the terms of this license have been waived:

> If you care to develop with Genesis3D 1.1, you may do so, free of licensing obligations as the engine is abandonware and the stakeholders are long gone.

As such, I am redistributing this as public domain or under the terms of the Zero-Clause BSD license as some territories do not legally recognize the public domain.

The terms of the Zero-Clause BSD license are thus:
